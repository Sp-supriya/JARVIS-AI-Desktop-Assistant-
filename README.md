# JARVIS-AI-Desktop-Assistant-
JARVIS AI is a voice-controlled desktop assistant that can perform various tasks using speech recognition. It interacts with users through voice commands and executes actions such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites, playing YouTube videos, sending emails, scheduling meetings, and even shutting down the computer.
The assistant is built using Python and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and process voice commands. It also incorporates machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors) to recommend the next action based on previous user interactions.

This project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition, automation, and AI to create an intelligent and efficient virtual assistant.
